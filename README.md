# IBM Model F AT Foam Cutout

This is an [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen)-based solution for producing Model F foam cutouts, and specifically this one was designed for the F AT. You could modify the code on a hosted [Ergogen web UI](https://ergogen.cache.works/) to fit your board's needs.
